        <h1>Unfolding Circle</h1>
<h2>An Orientation</h2>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><em>Becoming conscious is not a one-time thing. It is a continuous process, by the ego, of assimilating what was previously unknown to the ego. It involves a progressive understanding of why we do what we do.</em>
— Daryl Sharp</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>What Is This?</h2>
<p>You are entering a container. Over the next eight weeks you will be doing something deceptively simple: attending to and speaking the truth of your experience, and letting someone else witness it.</p>
<p>That's it. That's the whole practice.</p>
<p>But <em>that's it</em> turns out to be everything. Because what happens when you pay close attention — real attention, unhurried and non-instrumental — is that things <em>unfold</em>. Frozen things thaw. Confused things clarify. Things you didn't know you were carrying set themselves down. And a quality of aliveness that was always there, but obscured, begins to shine. Something that was folded up — contracted, protected, hidden perhaps even from yourself — opens. Not because of force, but because the conditions were finally right.</p>
<p>This document will orient you to the work. Read it and let it breathe. You might come back to it throughout the course. Some of what's here will make sense immediately. Some of it will only land after you've been in the practice for some time. Your view of the practice is part of the unfolding process.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Purpose of the Practice</h2>
<p>There are many true ways to describe what we're doing here, and we will explore some of my favorites here. Think of it like looking at a mountain from six different valleys. Each view is real. Each is partial. And the mountain itself is none of them.</p>
<p>Here are some ways of framing the purpose of this practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>To live a good, true, and beautiful life</li>
<li>To untangle and undistort our motivational system</li>
<li>To experience deep intimacy with all things</li>
<li>To move toward secure attachment with reality</li>
<li>To open the eye of value</li>
<li>To align ourselves with God's will</li>
</ul>
<p>As you read them notice which ones pull you. Perhaps notice which ones you resist. Both responses carry important information.</p>
<p>Each of these purposes is a complete description of the work. Each emphasizes something the others leave in the background. Together, they can help create a kind of resonance in the body — the felt sense that something real is being pointed to, even if no single phrase can capture it.</p>
<p>Let's look at each one.</p>
<h3>To Live a Good, True, and Beautiful Life</h3>
<p>The simplest frame, and perhaps the most radical. Not a life optimized for productivity or status or even happiness — but a life aligned with goodness, truth, and beauty as real features of reality. Not things we project onto a neutral world, but things we learn to <em>perceive</em> when the apparatus of perception is clear.</p>
<p>This is what the ancients meant by the good life — not comfort, but coherence. A life in which what you do, what you say, and what you most deeply are all point in the same direction. The practice clears the obstructions that prevent this alignment.</p>
<h3>To Untangle and Undistort Our Motivational System</h3>
<p>Every human being carries a vast, mostly unconscious web of desires, fears, protective strategies, and longings. Much of this system was laid down in childhood, before we had language, before we had choice. It was <em>adaptive</em>. It kept us alive, kept us connected, kept us from being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>But what was adaptive at three years old becomes a prison at thirty. The protective structures that once served us now distort our perception, constrict our range of response, and cut us off from the living reality of the present moment. We <em>think</em> we're making free choices. Mostly we're running old programs.</p>
<p>The clarification of desire — a concept at the very heart of this work — is the ongoing process of understanding why we do what we do. Not to judge it. Not to fix it. To <em>see</em> it, with the kind of radical honesty that gradually dissolves the difference between what we think we want and what we actually want.</p>
<p>As the motivational system untangles, something remarkable happens: desire clarifies. What felt like a confused mass of competing wants begins to reveal an underlying coherence. You discover that beneath the surface chaos, there is a direction your life has been trying to move all along. The distortions were never the truth of you. They were the noise. The signal was always there.</p>
<h3>To Experience Deep Intimacy with All Things</h3>
<p>Intimacy is not a feeling. It is a mode of contact. To be intimate with something is to meet it without the usual buffers — without concepts standing in for direct experience, without defenses filtering out what's too alive, too painful, too beautiful.</p>
<p>Most of us live behind glass. We see the world but don't quite <em>touch</em> it. The practice of unfolding is a practice of removing the glass — gradually, safely, in a held container — until you find yourself in direct contact with your own experience, with another person, with reality itself.</p>
<p>This is what the Church of the Intimate Web names as the Intimate Web: the network of living contact that emerges when people create and protect the conditions for genuine meeting. We are in the midst of a profound crisis of this intimacy — a Global Intimacy Disorder that sits at the root of nearly every other crisis we face. This practice is medicine for that disorder.</p>
<h3>To Move Toward Secure Attachment with Reality</h3>
<p>Attachment theory gives us a powerful frame for understanding what this practice does in the body and nervous system.</p>
<p>Secure attachment is the felt sense that the world is fundamentally safe enough to be yourself in. That you can reach out and something will reach back. That you won't be annihilated for having needs, or abandoned for being honest, or punished for being alive.</p>
<p>Most of us didn't get enough of this. Not because our caregivers were monsters, but because the culture itself is in a state of profound intimacy disorder. We pass our insecurity down like an inheritance, generation after generation, and build civilizations on top of it.</p>
<p>The practice of unfolding develops secure attachment — not with a person, but with reality itself. With what is. With the living process of your own experience. You learn that you can turn toward whatever arises in you — the grief, the rage, the tenderness, the confusion — and it won't destroy you. You learn that being seen doesn't mean being consumed. You learn that intimacy is not annihilation.</p>
<p>This is not metaphorical. It is literally what happens in the nervous system when the practice is working. The protective contractions soften. The hypervigilance relaxes. The chronic bracing against life — so constant you forgot it was there — begins to release. What remains is not a blank, not a void, but a profound aliveness.</p>
<h3>To Open the Eye of Value</h3>
<p>The Eye of Value is the organ of perception that perceives goodness, truth, and beauty in self, other, and world.</p>
<p>With the eye of value open, we tend to appreciate life, perceive goodness in the world, know the truth of our words, and love the beauty of nature. With the eye of value closed, we tend toward meaninglessness, confusion, and alienation.</p>
<p>Most people have experienced both states. The practice doesn't create the Eye of Value — you already have it. The practice removes what's obscuring it. Layer by layer, the distortions and protections that cloud perception are met with honest attention, and they soften. What remains is not something new. It's something that was always there, finally unobstructed.</p>
<p>Opening the eye of value occurs through the clarification of desire — the progressive understanding of why we do what we do, and the gradual dissolution of the gap between what we think we want and what we actually want.</p>
<h3>To Align Ourselves with God's Will</h3>
<p>Some of you will hear this language and feel it land in your bones. Others will flinch. Both responses are welcome here.</p>
<p>By "the will of God" we don't mean an external authority issuing commands. We mean something closer to what the mystics meant: the deepest current of reality, the direction that life itself wants to move when it's not being blocked or distorted. The Tao. The logos. The grain of the universe.</p>
<p>When we unfold, we are learning to feel that current. We are learning to stop swimming against it — not by surrendering our agency, but by discovering that our deepest agency <em>is</em> that current. The will of God and your truest will turn out to be the same thing. But you can't know that conceptually. You can only discover it by doing the work of clarification.</p>
<p>The Poetic Attunement — the love of goodness, truth, and beauty <em>for its own sake</em> — is what this alignment feels like from the inside. Not pursuing the good as a means to something else. Living in it, breathing it, being moved by it. This is the fundamental attunement. It is consonant with Buber's I-Thou. It is the opposite of the technological orientation that reduces everything to a means to an end.</p>
<h3>Finding Your Thread</h3>
<p>These six purposes are not six different things. They are six ways of describing one movement — like six facets of a single jewel, each catching a different angle of light.</p>
<p>The person who is living a good, true, and beautiful life <em>is</em> the person who has untangled their motivational system. The untangled heart naturally discovers deep intimacy with all things. That intimacy, held steadily, becomes secure attachment with reality. And in that security, the eye of value opens — revealing what was always there. The person seeing with the eye of value <em>is</em> the person aligned with God's will.</p>
<p>Now — read back through those six purposes slowly. With your body, not just your mind. Notice which ones create movement in you. Which phrases make something quicken or soften or lean forward? Which ones do you resist, and what does that resistance feel like?</p>
<p>You don't need to pick one. You don't need to have the right answer. But we want you to begin locating your own <em>alive current of desire</em> in relationship to this constellation of ways of looking.</p>
<p>Can you find it? The thread that connects you to this work — not as an idea, but as a felt pull? Maybe it's the longing for a good and beautiful life. Maybe it's the ache to be met without agenda. Maybe it's a wordless sense that something in you has been trying to unfold for a long time, and this might be the container where it finally can.</p>
<p>Whatever it is — that's your entry point. That's where the practice begins for you. Come to the first session holding that thread. We'll work with it from there.</p>

<h2>The Philosophical Ground</h2>
<p>This work draws on several streams of practice and thought. You don't need to study any of them to do the practice. But you may want to explore the lineage streams around some of the teachings and frameworks we will explore in the course.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://integralunfoldment.com/">Steve March's Aletheia Unfoldment</a></strong> — The primary methodological foundation. Aletheia (Greek: <em>unconcealment</em>, <em>truth</em>) is a practice of facilitating the natural unfolding of another person's inner process through deep listening, clean questions, and non-interference.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.planetarydharma.com/">John Churchill's Planetary Dharma</a></strong> — An integral contemplative practice path that weaves together psychodynamic healing, adult development, and meditation. From Planetary Dharma we take the emphasis on working contemplatively with the attachment system, and the fundamental necessity of safety and attunement in the unfolding process.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://worldphilosophyandreligion.org/">David J. Temple's CosmoErotic Humanism</a></strong> — A comprehensive ontology that places <em>eros</em> — the movement toward deeper contact and greater wholeness — at the heart of reality itself. From CosmoErotic Humanism we take the understanding that the Eye of Value is not a subjective projection but an organ of perception disclosing something real. Value is not something we invent. It is something we learn to see.</p>

<h2>The Structure</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 weeks — March 5 through April 23, 2026</li>
<li><strong>Format:</strong> Small group cohort</li>
<li><strong>Practice commitment:</strong> 30 minutes daily solo practice, 2 hours weekly dyad practice, 90 minutes weekly teaching call</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Three Containers</h3>
<p><strong>Solo Practice (30 min/day)</strong></p>
<p>This is your daily practice of turning attention inward. Sit. Get quiet. Notice what's here. Let it unfold. You are learning to hold yourself with the same quality of non-instrumental attention that your partner will hold for you in the dyads.</p>
<p><strong>Dyad Practice (90 min/week)</strong></p>
<p>Each week you will be paired with a new practice partner for two 45-minute sessions — one where you hold space, one where you take space.</p>
<p>When you are <em>taking</em>, your only job is to be with and speak to the truth of your experience. Let the unfolding happen. Trust the process and your partner's presence.</p>
<p>When you are <em>holding</em>, your job is to create and protect sacred space. To be a mirror, not a fixer. To track, contact, and reflect what you see — without interfering, without importing your own experience, without trying to make anything happen. You are supporting your partner in coming into relationship with reality. <em>It is profoundly not about you.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weekly Teaching Call (90 min)</strong></p>
<p>Each week we gather as a full cohort for teaching, discussion, and shared practice. These calls will mostly be responsive to whatever you bring from your practice.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What I Ask of You</h2>
<p><strong>Show up.</strong>  This is the most important thing. Attend the group calls, do your daily solo practice, and don't ghost your partner. The more you show up the more everyone will show up, and the more powerful the container will be. If you have to reschedule for some reason please communicate it. If you can't make the group call let me know so we aren't waiting for you. </p>
<p><strong>Protect the container.</strong> What happens in dyads stays in dyads. Confidentiality is essential for safety.</p>
<p><strong>Do the daily practice.</strong> Thirty minutes. Every day. The solo practice is what allows the dyad work to go deep. It really makes a difference. </p>
<p><strong>Trust the process.</strong> Things will come up that don't make sense. Emotions will arrive without explanation. Parts of you that you'd forgotten will show up asking to be seen. Let them. The practice knows what it's doing, even when you don't.</p>
<p><strong>Be gentle with yourself and others.</strong> This work stirs the waters. Old pain surfaces. Defenses activate. People get clumsy. Extend to yourself and your cohort the same non-instrumental love that the practice is teaching you.</p>
<hr />
<h2>A Note on Language</h2>
<p>You'll notice that this document holds theological language ("the will of God," "sacred space") alongside psychological language ("motivational system," "attachment") alongside contemplative language ("the Eye of Value," "the Poetic Attunement"). This is intentional.</p>
<p>We live in a time when people are profoundly distrustful of overarching frameworks — and for good reason. Human beings have been using concepts and truth claims to dominate others for millennia. We have been, in a sense, traumatized by concepts.</p>
<p>And yet we need shared language to do this work together. So we hold our language lightly. I use multiple frames not to be vague, but to be <em>precise</em> about something that no single frame can capture. Each concept in this document is like a node in a web — it illuminates the others, and is illuminated by them.</p>
<p>If the God language doesn't land for you, use the psychology. If the psychology feels too clinical, try the contemplative vocabulary. If none of the words work, throw them all away and just do the practice. The words point at something that is prior to language. The practice will take you there regardless of which words you use to describe the journey.</p>
<hr />
<h2>An Invitation Before We Begin</h2>
<p>Before our first session, I'd like to ask you to do something.</p>
<p>Read back through the six purposes of the practice — slowly, with your body, not just your mind. Notice which ones create movement in you. Which phrases make something quicken or soften or lean forward? Which ones do you resist, and what does that resistance feel like?</p>
<p>You don't need to pick one. You don't need to have the right answer. But we want you to begin locating your own <em>alive current of desire</em> in relationship to this constellation of ways of looking.</p>
<p>Can you find it? The thread that connects you to this work — not as an idea, but as a felt pull? Maybe it's the longing for a good and beautiful life. Maybe it's the ache to be met without agenda. Maybe it's a wordless sense that something in you has been trying to unfold for a long time, and this might be the container where it finally can.</p>
<p>Whatever it is — that's your entry point. That's where the practice begins for you. Come to the first session holding that thread. We'll work with it from there.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Before We Begin</h2>
<p>You are about to enter into one of the most intimate forms of practice that exists. You will allow yourself to be deeply seen by another human being. And you will learn to be the kind of person around whom others feel safe enough to reveal themselves. </p>
<p>This is ancient work. Every wisdom tradition has some version of it — the spiritual friend, the holy listener, the sacred witness. What we're doing here is not new. What's new is the architecture: the explicit training, the networked community, the philosophical rigor that allows the practice to be (I hope) transmitted without losing its soul.</p>
<p>The essence of this work is simply showing up to practice. You and your practice partner, together in honest attention. You and the rest of the cohort, showing up every week to explore and clarify. You and reality, slowly learning to trust each other.</p>
<p>Welcome to The Unfolding.</p>
<p>Let's begin.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>March 5 – April 23, 2026</em>
*The Unfoldingworks when you're willing to be seen — in your confusion, your grief, your tenderness, your not-knowing. You don't need to be brave. You just need to be real.</p>
<p><strong>Protect the container.</strong> What happens in dyads stays in dyads. Confidentiality is the bedrock of sacred space. Without it, nothing unfolds.</p>
<p><strong>Do the daily practice.</strong> Thirty minutes, every day. This is not optional. The solo practice is what allows the dyad work to go deep. Without it, we're just having nice conversations.</p>
<p><strong>Trust the process.</strong> Things will come up that don't make sense. Emotions will arrive without explanation. Parts of you that you'd forgotten will show up asking to be seen. Let them. The practice knows what it's doing, even when you don't.</p>
<p><strong>Be gentle with yourself and others.</strong> This work stirs the waters. Old pain surfaces. Defenses activate. People get clumsy. Extend to yourself and your cohort the same quality of care that the practice is teaching you.</p>
