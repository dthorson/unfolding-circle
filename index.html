        <h1>The Unfolding Circle</h1>
<h2>An Orientation</h2>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><em>Becoming conscious is not a one-time thing. It is a continuous process of assimilating what was previously unknown. It involves a progressive understanding of why we do what we do.</em>
— Daryl Sharp</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>What Is This?</h2>
<p>During our time together we will be doing something deceptively simple: attending to and speaking the truth of your experience, and letting someone else witness it.</p>
<p>That's it. That's the whole practice.</p>
<p>But <em>that's it</em> turns out to be everything. Because what happens when you relate to experience in this way is that things <em>unfold</em>. Frozen things thaw. Confused things clarify. Things you didn't know you were carrying set themselves down. And a quality of aliveness that was always there, but obscured, begins to shine. Not because of force, but because the conditions were finally right.</p>
<p>This document will orient you to the practice we'll be doing together. Read it and let it breathe. You might come back to it throughout the course. Some of what's here will make sense immediately. Some of it will only land after you've been in the practice for some time. Your view of the practice is part of the unfolding.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Structure</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 weeks — March 5 through April 23, 2026</li>
<li><strong>Practice commitment:</strong> 30 minutes daily solo practice, 90 minutes weekly dyad practice, 90 minutes weekly teaching call</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Three Practices</h3>
<p><strong>Solo Practice (30 min/day)</strong></p>
<p>This is your daily practice of turning attention inward. Sit. Get quiet. Notice what's here. Let it unfold. You are learning to hold yourself with the same quality of non-instrumental attention that your partner will hold for you in the dyads.</p>
<p><strong>Dyad Practice (90 min/week)</strong></p>
<p>Each week you will be paired with a new practice partner for two 45-minute sessions — one where you hold space, one where you take space.</p>
<p>When you are <em>taking space</em>, your only job is to be with and speak to the truth of your experience. Let the unfolding happen. Trust the process and your partner's presence.</p>
<p>When you are <em>holding space</em>, your job is to create and protect sacred space. To be a mirror, not a fixer. To track, contact, and reflect what you see — without interfering, without importing your own experience, without trying to make anything happen. You are supporting your partner in coming into relationship with reality. <em>It is profoundly not about you.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weekly Teaching Call (90 min)</strong></p>
<p>Each week I'll gather the full cohort for teaching, discussion, and shared practice. These calls will mostly be responsive to whatever you bring from your practice.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What I Ask of You</h2>
<p><strong>Show up.</strong> This is the most important thing. Attend the group calls, do your daily solo practice, and don't ghost your partner. The more you show up the more everyone will show up, and the more powerful the container will be. If you have to reschedule, please communicate it. If you can't make the group call, let me know so we aren't waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>Protect the container.</strong> What happens in dyads stays in dyads. Confidentiality is essential for safety.</p>
<p><strong>Do the daily practice.</strong> Thirty minutes, every day. The solo practice is what allows the dyad work to go deep. It really makes a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Trust the process.</strong> Things will come up that don't make sense. Emotions will arrive without explanation. Parts of you that you'd forgotten will show up asking to be seen. Let them. The practice knows what it's doing, even when you don't.</p>
<p><strong>Be gentle with yourself and others.</strong> This work stirs the waters. Old pain surfaces. Defenses activate. People get clumsy. Extend to yourself and your cohort the same quality of care that the practice is teaching you.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Purpose of the Practice</h2>
<p>There are many true ways to describe what this practice is for — perhaps infinitely many. These are some of my favorites. Think of it like looking at a mountain from different valleys. Each view is real. Each is partial. And the mountain itself is none of them.</p>
<p>Here are some ways of framing the purpose of this practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>To live a good, true, and beautiful life</li>
<li>To untangle and undistort our motivational system</li>
<li>To move toward secure attachment with reality</li>
<li>To align ourselves with God's will</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these purposes is a complete description of the work. Each emphasizes something the others leave in the background. Together, they can help create a kind of resonance in the body — the felt sense that something real is being pointed to, even if no single phrase can capture it.</p>
<p>Let's look at each one.</p>
<h3>To Live a Good, True, and Beautiful Life</h3>
<p>The simplest frame, and perhaps the most radical. Not a life optimized for productivity or status or even happiness — but a life aligned with goodness, truth, and beauty as real features of reality. Not things we project onto a neutral world, but things we learn to <em>perceive</em> when the apparatus of perception is clear.</p>
<p>This is what the ancients meant by the good life — not comfort, but coherence. A life in which what you do, what you say, and what you most deeply are all point in the same direction. The practice clears the obstructions that prevent this alignment.</p>
<h3>To Untangle and Undistort Our Motivational System</h3>
<p>Every human being carries a vast, mostly unconscious web of desires, fears, protective strategies, and longings. Much of this system was laid down in childhood, before we had language, before we had choice. It was <em>adaptive</em>. It kept us alive, kept us connected, kept us from being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>But what was adaptive at three years old becomes a prison at thirty. The protective structures that once served us now distort our perception, constrict our range of response, and cut us off from the living reality of the present moment. We <em>think</em> we're making free choices. Mostly we're running old programs.</p>
<p>The clarification of desire — a concept at the very heart of this work — is the ongoing process of understanding why we do what we do. Not to judge it. Not to fix it. To <em>see</em> it, with the kind of radical honesty that gradually dissolves the difference between what we think we want and what we actually want.</p>
<p>As the motivational system untangles, something remarkable happens: desire clarifies. What felt like a confused mass of competing wants begins to reveal an underlying coherence. You discover that beneath the surface chaos, there is a direction your life has been trying to move all along. The distortions were never the truth of you. They were the noise. The signal was always there.</p>
<h3>To Move Toward Secure Attachment with Reality</h3>
<p>Most of us live behind glass. We see the world but don't quite <em>touch</em> it. We pass through our days buffered — by concepts, by defenses, by the chronic bracing that became so constant we forgot it was there.</p>
<p>Secure attachment is the felt sense that the world is fundamentally safe enough to be yourself in. That you can reach out and something will reach back. That you won't be annihilated for having needs, or abandoned for being honest, or punished for being alive.</p>
<p>Most of us didn't get enough of this. Not because our caregivers were monsters, but because the culture itself is in a state of profound intimacy disorder. We pass our insecurity down like an inheritance, generation after generation, and build civilizations on top of it.</p>
<p>The practice of unfolding develops secure attachment — not with a person, but with reality itself. With what is. With the living process of your own experience. You learn that you can turn toward whatever arises in you — the grief, the rage, the tenderness, the confusion — and it won't destroy you. You learn that being seen doesn't mean being consumed. You learn that intimacy is not annihilation.</p>
<p>This is not metaphorical. It is literally what happens in the nervous system when the practice is working. The protective contractions soften. The hypervigilance relaxes. The glass begins to thin. What remains is not a blank, not a void, but a profound aliveness — and a deepening contact with reality that has no ceiling. Each layer you meet reveals another layer beneath it, richer and more alive. The intimacy available to a human being appears to be bottomless.</p>
<h3>To Align Ourselves with God's Will</h3>
<p>Some of you will hear this language and feel it land in your bones. Others will flinch. Both responses are welcome here.</p>
<p>By "the will of God" I don't mean an external authority issuing commands. I mean something closer to what the mystics meant: the deepest current of reality, the direction that life itself wants to move when it's not being blocked or distorted. The Tao. The logos. The grain of the universe.</p>
<p>When you unfold, you are learning to feel that current. Learning to stop swimming against it — not by surrendering our agency, but by discovering that our deepest agency <em>is</em> that current. The will of God and your truest will turn out to be the same thing. But you can't know that conceptually. You can only discover it by doing the work of clarification.</p>
<p>The Poetic Attunement — the love of goodness, truth, and beauty <em>for its own sake</em> — is what this alignment feels like from the inside. Not pursuing the good as a means to something else. Living in it, breathing it, being moved by it. This is the fundamental attunement. It is consonant with Buber's I-Thou. It is the opposite of the technological orientation that reduces everything to a means to an end.</p>
<h3>Finding Your Thread</h3>
<p>These purposes are not different things. They are different ways of looking at one movement.</p>
<p>The person who is living a good, true, and beautiful life <em>is</em> the person who has untangled their motivational system. The untangled heart, held steadily, leads to secure attachment with reality. And the person resting in secure attachment with reality <em>is</em> the person aligned with God's will — whether or not they use that language.</p>
<p>You might read back through these frames slowly. Notice which ones create movement in you. Which phrases make something quicken or soften or lean forward?</p>
<p>You don't need to pick one, but I want you to begin locating your own <em>alive current of desire</em> in relationship to this practice.</p>
<p>Can you find it? The thread that connects you to this work — not as an idea, but as a felt pull? Maybe it's the longing for a good and beautiful life. Maybe it's the ache to be met without agenda. Maybe it's a wordless sense that something in you has been trying to unfold for a long time, and this might be the container where it finally can.</p>
<p>Whatever it is — that's your entry point. That's where the practice begins for you.</p>
<hr />
<h2>A Note on Language</h2>
<p>You'll notice this document holds theological language ("the will of God," "sacred space") alongside psychological language ("motivational system," "attachment") alongside contemplative language ("the Poetic Attunement," "the clarification of desire"). This is intentional.</p>
<p>We live in a time when people are profoundly distrustful of overarching frameworks — and for good reason. We have been, in a sense, traumatized by concepts. And yet we need shared language to do this work together. So I hold my language lightly. I use multiple frames not to be vague, but to be <em>precise</em> about something that no single frame can capture.</p>
<p>If the God language doesn't land for you, use the psychology. If the psychology feels too clinical, try the contemplative vocabulary. If none of the words work, throw them all away and just do the practice. The words point at something prior to language. The practice will take you there regardless.</p>
<hr />
<h2>An Invitation Before We Start</h2>
<p>You are about to enter into one of the most intimate forms of practice that exists. You will allow yourself to be deeply seen by another human being. And you will learn to hold a space that others will feel safe to reveal themselves.</p>
<p>This is ancient work. Every wisdom tradition has some version of it — the spiritual friend, the holy listener, the sacred witness. What I'm offering here is not new. What's perhaps new is the architecture: the explicit training, the networked community, the philosophical rigor that allows the practice to be (I hope) transmitted in this context without losing its soul.</p>
<p>The essence of this work is simply showing up to practice. You and your practice partner, together in honest attention. You and the rest of the cohort, showing up every week to explore and clarify. You and reality, slowly learning to trust each other.</p>
<p>I look forward to beginning with you on March 5th. In the meantime — sit with the thread you found. Let it work on you. Let it unfold.</p>

            <h2>Lineage Streams</h2>
<p>This work draws on several streams of practice and thought. You don't need to study any of them to do the practice. But if you're curious about the lineages behind the teachings and frameworks I'll be drawing on, here are some starting points.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://integralunfoldment.com/">Steve March's Aletheia Unfoldment</a></strong> — The primary methodological foundation. Aletheia (Greek: <em>unconcealment</em>, <em>truth</em>) is a practice of facilitating the natural unfolding of another person's interior through deep listening, clean questions, and non-interference.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.planetarydharma.com/">John Churchill's Planetary Dharma</a></strong> — An integral contemplative practice path that weaves together psychodynamic healing, adult development, and meditation. From Planetary Dharma I take the emphasis on working contemplatively with the attachment system, and the fundamental necessity of safety and attunement in the unfolding process.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://worldphilosophyandreligion.org/">David J. Temple's CosmoErotic Humanism</a></strong> — A comprehensive ontology that places <em>eros</em> — the movement toward deeper contact and greater wholeness — at the heart of reality itself. From CosmoErotic Humanism I take the understanding that goodness, truth, and beauty are not subjective projections but real features of reality that we can learn to perceive more clearly. Value is not something we invent. It is something we learn to see.</p>
